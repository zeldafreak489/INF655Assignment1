# Iris Perry INF655 Assignment 2

This is my repository for my submission for Assignment 2 for INF 655 - Front End Web Devlopment 2.

It is a React app with the following components:
- Functional component that displays a greeting and the current date.
- Class component that displays a user's name and profession using state. It also displays a lucky number for the user.
- Another functional component that contains an array of tasks and a function to choose a random task from the array and displays it.
- Greeting component has been updated to accept a prop called username.
- Counter component created that uses useState to track a count value when the button is pressed.
- A list of tasks with keys was added to App.jsx and uses the .map() function to display the tasks in a unordered list.
- UserInfo component was modified to accept a prop called handleClick and it shows an alert when a button is clicked.
- A form was added that allows the user to submit a task. The task is then logged to the console.

Each one of these components is imported into the App.js file.
