# Iris Perry INF655 Assignment 1

This is my repository for my submission for Assignment 1 for INF 655 - Front End Web Devlopment 2.

It is a React app with the following components:
- Functional component that displays a greeting and the current date.
- Class component that displays a user's name and profession using state. It also displays a lucky number for the user.
- Another functional component that contains an array of tasks and a function to choose a random task from the array and displays it.

Each one of these components is imported into the App.js file.
